# Contributing to GraalPy

Thanks for considering to contribute! 
To get you started, read about the structure of this implementation.

You will need to sign the [Oracle Contributor Agreement](http://www.graalvm.org/community/contributors/) for us to be able to merge your work.

Please also take some time to review our [code of conduct](http://www.graalvm.org/community/conduct/) for contributors.

## Getting Started

The first thing you want to do is to set up [`mx`](https://github.com/graalvm/mx.git).
This is the build tool we use to develop GraalVM languages.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/graalvm/mx.git
```
Make sure to add the `mx` directory to your `PATH`.

Use `mx` to get additional projects at the right versions.
From within your `graalpython` checkout, run:
```
mx sforceimport
```

You can then download a suitable JDK:
```bash
mx -p ../graal/vm --env ce-python fetch-jdk -A --jdk-id labsjdk-ce-latest
```

Make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME="${HOME}/.mx/jdks/labsjdk-ce-latest
```

(Or on Windows)
```
$env:JAVA_HOME="$HOME\.mx\jdks\labsjdk-ce-latest"
```

For building GraalPy, you will also need some native build tools and libraries. On a Debian based system, install:
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libc++-12-dev zlib1g-dev cmake
```

(On Windows, make sure you are running in a Visual Studio Developer Powershell, that should have everything you need.)

Lastly, download maven, extract it and include it on your `PATH`.

Once you have all the necessary tools, you can run `mx python-jvm` in this repository.
This will initially download the required dependencies next to the repository and build Python.
If it succeeds without errors, you should already be able to run `mx python` and get a REPL.

For development, we recommend running `mx ideinit` next.
This will generate configurations for Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans so that you can open the projects in these IDEs.
See also the documentation in mx for [setting up your IDE](https://github.com/graalvm/mx/blob/master/docs/IDE.md).
If you use another editor (such as VSCode, Emacs, or Neovim) with support for the [Eclipse language server](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls) or [Apache NetBeans language server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ASF.apache-netbeans-java), you can also get useable development setups with that, but it's not something we explicitly support.

## Development Layout

Besides the source code of the Python interpreter, we have some useful `mx` functions defined under the _mx.graalpython_ directory.
As you make changes, you can always test them with `mx python-jvm && mx python`.
Additionally, there are various "gates" that we use on our CI systems to check any code that is committed. 
You can run all the gates with the command `mx python-gate` or just some by using `mx python-gate --tags [TAG]`.
Interesting gates to run that cover a good chunk of the code things are:

- `python-unittest` - Run the unit tests written in Python, including those for the C extension API
- `python-junit` - Run the unit tests written in Java.
- `python-license` - Check that all files have the correct copyright headers applied to them

### Built-In Modules and Classes

For the most part, built-in modules and classes are implemented in the `com.oracle.graal.python.builtins` package. For each module or class, there's a Java class annotated with `@CoreFunctions`.
Each function in a module or a class is implemented in a Node annotated with `@Builtin`.
Take a look at the existing implementations to get a feel for how this is done.
For now, when adding new classes or modules, they need to be added to the list in `com.oracle.graal.python.builtins.Python3Core`.

Some built-in functions, modules, and classes are implemented in pure Python.
The files for these are in the _graalpython/lib-graalpython_ directory.
These files are listed in the Java `com.oracle.graal.python.builtins.Python3Core` class.
Take a look at these files to see what they do.
If a file is called exactly as a built-in module is, it is executed in the context of that module during startup, so some of our modules are implemented both in Java and Python.
If the name does not match an existing module, the file is executed just for its side-effects.

When implementing a new (or fixing an existing) built-in, take a look at the CPython source.
The layout and naming of modules and types is kept similar to the CPython source so it should be relatively easy to find the right piece of code.
For some special _dunder_ methods (`__add__`, `__getitem__`, `__getattribute__`, ...) you may have to figure out the C API slot names for them to find the right piece of code (`nb_add`, `sq_item`, `tp_getattr`, ...).

You will find that often there are specific C API methods that are called to convert or coerce arguments, to look up methods either starting on the object or only on the class, to call a callable object or invoke a method, and more.
In general, most of these methods should have equivalents in our libs nodes in the `com.oracle.graal.python.lib` package.
If something is missing that is commonly used, we probably have some Node for it somewhere, but it may be a good idea to create a lib node and migrate usages.

GraalPy has its own variant of the Argument Clinic preprocessor.
It is activated by: 
* extending `PythonXXXClinicBuiltinNode` (e.g. `PythonBinaryClinicBuiltinNode`),
* using `@ArgumentClinic` annotations on the built-in node class,
* and overriding the `getArgumentClinic` method to return the class that will be generated from the annotations (it will be named the same as the node class plus `ClinicProviderGen` suffix).

Sometimes, you will not easily find what exactly happens for a given piece of code when that involves more than just a simple built-in call.
The `dis` CPython module can often help get an angle on what a particular piece of code is doing.
You can call `dis.dis` on any Python function and it will print details of the bytecode and associated data, which can be a good starting point to browse through the CPython source.

### Python C API

The C implementation and headers for our C API are in the _graalpython/com.oracle.graal.python.cext_ directory.
The naming is analogous to CPython's source names.
This directory also includes a _modules_ directory for built-in modules that we have adapted from CPython.

## Debug options

GraalPy provides multiple debug options.
It is possible to either debug the Python code using a Chrome debugger, or the Java code using your preferred IDE.

To debug Python code using Chrome, run this:
```bash
mx python --inspect --inspect.Internal your_script.py
```

This will open a debug server, which can be accessed in a Chrome Browser via the URL `chrome://inspect`.

For debugging Java-implemented code run:
```bash
mx python --experimental-options -debug-java your_script.py
```

The command will also start a debug server, which can be used in an IDE.
If the IDE was initialized properly by using the command mentioned above, the existing `GraalDebug` run configuration can be used to debug.

Both of these commands also work when you have a `graalpy` executable, e.g. inside a `venv`.

For debugging the C API and native extensions, first make sure you rebuild (`mx clean` first!) graalpython with the environment variable `CFLAGS=-g` set.
This will keep debug symbols in our C API implementation which should allow you to use `gdb` or [`rr`](https://rr-project.org/) to debug.
When you build an SVM image, debugging the entire application is possible, and there are [docs](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/guides/debug-native-image-process/) to see Java code when inside the native debugger.
Make sure you find and keep the `libpythonvm.so.debug` file around next to your GraalPy build, you can find it under `mxbuild/*/libpythonvm`.

## Advanced Commands to Develop and Debug

Here are some advanced commands to debug test failures and fix issues.

First, we have three sets of unit tests in the base repository:
1. Our own Python-bases unit tests
2. JUnit tests
3. Python's standard library tests, we often refer to those as tagged tests

To run the first, you can use this command:

```bash
mx python-gate --tags python-unittest
```

If some of the tests fail, you can re-run just a single test like this, substituting TEST-SELECTOR with the test you want to run. You can use the whole failed test name including the path as the selector.
Note that you can insert `-d` to debug on the Java level or use `--inspect` to debug in the Chrome debugger.

```bash
mx [-d] graalpytest [--inspect] TEST-SELECTOR
```

To run the JUnit tests, you can use this command:

```bash
mx python-gate --tags python-junit
```

To run a subset of the tests, you can use the following.
Again, you can use `-d` to attach with a Java debugger.

```bash
mx [-d] punittest JAVA-TEST-CLASSNAME
```

To run the Python standard library tests, you can use the following:

```bash
mx python-gate --tags python-tagged-unittest
```

Note that we use "tag files", small _*.txt_ files that select which tests to run, so we only run tests that we know should pass.
To run a subset of those tests, use the following command. The selector can be a test name, a test file path a glob or an individual test ID.

```
mx [-d] graalpytest [--inspect] --tagged TEST-SELECTOR
```

A tag file can be regenerated with

```
mx graalpytest --retag TEST-SELECTOR
```

There are also several other gates that may fail with changes.
One of these is our *style* gate, which checks formatting rules and copyrights.
To auto-fix most issues, run the following commands.
Anything that's reported as an error after this command you have to fix manually.
Note that to really match what's in the gate, you have to set the `JDT` environment variable to the path of an Eclipse compiler Jar file, and the `ECLIPSE_EXE` environment variable to the path of an eclipse executable.

```bash
mx python-style --fix
mx python-gate --tags style
```

Another important gate is the one that checks if you broke Native Image building.
To test if building a native executable still works, you can use the following command.
This will create a native executable called `graalpy` and print its path as the last output, if successful.

```bash
mx python-svm
```

If you made changes to the parser, you may have to regenerate the golden files like so:

```bash
find graalpython -name '*.scope' -delete
find graalpython -name '*.tast' -delete
mx punittest com.oracle.graal.python.pegparser
```

If you made changes to the bytecode compiler, you may have to regenerate its golden files:

```bash
find graalpython -name '*.co' -delete
mx punittest com.oracle.graal.python.test.compiler
```

## Benchmarking

We use the `mx` facilities for benchmarking.
Use this to list the available Python suites and VM configurations:

```bash
mx benchmark --list
```

If you just want to run a single benchmark from, for example, the `meso` suite, you can use this:

```bash
mx benchmark meso --list
```

Then if you want to run something, use (for example):

```bash
mx benchmark meso:nbody3
```

To select which Python VM you want to use, you can pass the arguments separated by `--`:

```bash
mx benchmark meso:nbody3 \
    -- --python-vm=cpython
```

For additional arguments to the Python launcher, you can separate them by another double-dash:

```bash
mx benchmark meso:nbody3 \
    -- --python-vm=graalpython \
    -- --python.EmulateJython \
    -Dgraal.Dump= \
    -Dgraal.MethodFilter=*measure*
```

### A note on terminology

Note that there may be a little confusion about the configuration names of benchmarks.

#### GraalVM Community Edition and Oracle GraalVM configurations

We have benchmarks for GraalVM Community Edition and Oracle GraalVM.
For historical reasons, these are sometimes referred to in some config files as *CE* and *EE*; *core* and *enterprise*; *graalvm_ce* and *graalvm_ee*; or *graalpython_core* and *graalpython_enterprise*, respectively.

### Different GraalVM Python configurations

There are also different options for how the Python interpreter is run, passed via the `--python-vm-config` parameter:
 * `default` - run using the standard options
 * `default-multi` - run using a shared engine, which is the mode that is recommended to embedders that want to spawn multiple isolated Python contexts
 * `native` - same as `default`, its name is due to the fact that it runs C extensions using a mixture of LLVM bitcode interpreted and compiled via GraalVM and real native libraries
 * `sandboxed` - this name is historical - this configuration runs some modules such as the posix and sha3 modules with Java code instead of with native access.

### Configuration of the underlying GraalVM runtime

Finally, there are the `--jvm` and `--jvm-config` configuration options for `mx benchmark`.
By default, the commands presented above will run on the JVM in *server* mode, using the Graal compiler in what we call *hosted* mode.
This is almost the same but not quite the `--jvm` mode you will get when running the `graalpy` executable from a full GraalVM, and usually good enough if you want to look at the compiler graphs or peak performance numbers.
In our CI, however, we always build a full GraalVM and benchmark using that, since that is what we ship.
There, we have two different configurations corresponding to the launcher options available for the GraalVM `graalpy` executable: *jvm* and *native*.
The first runs on top of HotSpot using the Graal compiler, and the second runs the AOT compiled GraalVM native executable of Python.

Building a GraalVM Python configuration can be achieved for the CE version like so:

```bash
mx --env ../../graal/vm/mx.vm/ce \
    --exclude-components=slgm \
    --dynamicimports /vm graalvm-show
mx --env ../../graal/vm/mx.vm/ce \
    --exclude-components=slgm \
    --dynamicimports /vm build
```

The first command will print some information about the GraalVM configuration that is about to be built, and the second will build it. 
>**IMPORTANT:** The first command should tell you that the `Config name` is `ce_python`, otherwise the next commands will not work.

To run the JVM configuration:

```bash
mx --env ../../graal/vm/mx.vm/ce \
    --exclude-components=slgm \
    --dynamicimports /vm benchmark meso:nbody3 \
    -- --python-vm=graalpython \
    --jvm=graalvm-ce-python \
    --jvm-config=jvm \
    --python-vm-config=default --
```

To run the Native Image configuration:

```bash
mx --env ../../graal/vm/mx.vm/ce \
    --exclude-components=slgm \
    --dynamicimports /vm benchmark meso:nbody3 \
    -- --python-vm=graalpython \
    --jvm=graalvm-ce-python \
    --jvm-config=native \
    --python-vm-config=default --
```
